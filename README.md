# Peer-graded Assignment: Regression Models Course Project

## Overview
This repo was prepared by Yohance Nicholas in partial fulfilment of the [Regression Models Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-models/home/welcome) which comprises one of the five courses necessary for the Data Science: Statistics and Machine Specialization offered by Johns Hopikins University through Coursera. 

In this report, candidates wear the hat of a *Motor Trend Researcher* who seeks to explore the relationship between vehicle characteristics and fuel efficiency with the assistance of the `mtcars` data set.     This data, which was extracted from the 1974 *Motor Trend* US magazine, comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). 

Exploratory data analyses and regression models are utilised to mainly explore the extent to which  **automatic** (am = 0) and **manual** (am = 1) transmissions features impact fuel efficiency, as measured by the the Miles/(US) gallon variable - **MPG** .   The research begins with data preparation and exploratory data analysis. Subsequently, several candidate linear regression models are estimated in order to identify the model with the best fit - i.e. the highest Adjusted R-squared value. 

## Key Questions
*The Board fo Directors at Motor Trend* is particularly interested in the following:

1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG? 
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

## Contents 
This repository contains the following files:

- `README.md`- which provides an overview of the dataset and how it was created
- `regression_mpg_transmission.Rmd` - which contains the R Markdown for the report generated
- `regression_mpg_transmission.pdf`- the PDF submitted to Coursera 
- `Regression-Models.zip`- which contains high resolution PNGs of the plots generated in the investigation
